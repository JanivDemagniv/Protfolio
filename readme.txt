This is my personal portfolio project showcasing my skills and projects. The portfolio includes a gallery with 6 sample landing pages that I created using HTML, CSS, SASS, and Bootstrap.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure and content of the web pages.
CSS: For styling and layout.
SASS: For more efficient and modular CSS.
Bootstrap: For responsive design and pre-built components.
Features
Responsive Design: Ensures that the portfolio looks good on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
Gallery: A collection of 6 unique landing pages, each demonstrating different design styles and functionalities.

I used main SASS to style the main Protfoli page.
it helped me a lot to keep track of my CSS code, and style the projects landing pages.
I used bootstrap to easly deal with my "weaker" part of the webdesing - mainly for the NavBar.

The gallery contains the following landing pages:

Landing Page 1: The Coffe landing page
this landing page contain a large picture and a form.
Landing Page 2: Let us lead landing page
